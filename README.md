compiler
========

An introductory Pascal Compiler that has a web front end, where a typed program is tokenized, converted to MSIL, and then executed in simple easy to understand steps! Good learning exercise for a compiler!

The code was written in C#, and converts PASCAL code to MSIL Assembler, and then executes it using the C# Virtual Machine. 

It handles the following:-

1. Variable Declaration /Assignment
2. Assignment of Complex Expressions with Brackets (Converts Infix to PostFix)
3. While Loops / ForLoops / Repeat Loops
4. Print Statement 
5. Extensive Validation of Incorrect Syntax
6. If Else If Costruct
7. Evaluate Conditional Logic (a < b or b >c and c <d )...etc
